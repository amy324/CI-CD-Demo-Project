# CI/CD Demo Project

This repository serves as a demonstration project specifically created to showcase the usage of the CI/CD Pipeline Automation Tool available at [CI/CD Tool](https://github.com/amy324/CI-CD-Tool).

## Purpose

The purpose of this demo project is to illustrate how the CI/CD Pipeline Automation Tool can be integrated with a Go project repository to automate the CI/CD pipeline tasks such as configuring pipeline settings, fetching source code, running tests, and deploying applications.
It is an intentionally simple project in order to accurately serve as a demonstration for the CI/CD Tool.

## Usage

To understand how the CI/CD Pipeline Automation Tool interacts with this demo project, please refer to the [CI/CD Tool](https://github.com/amy324/CI-CD-Tool) repository and its documentation.

## Contents

This repository contains a simple Go project with the following files:

- `main.go`: Contains the main application logic and interaction with the CI/CD Pipeline Automation Tool.
- `handler.go`: Example handler implementation.
- `handler_test.go`: Example unit tests for the handler implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CI/CD Pipeline Automation Tool and this demo project, follow these steps:
